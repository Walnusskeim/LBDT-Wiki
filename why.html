			<p>
			  All the available licenses would be enough, if there wasn't a problem: Nearly all licenses allow it, 
			  so that others can modify or distribute your creation. Not only that, they also have the ability to 
			  make money off of it.

			  I think it's time to put the creator, the artist, first.
			  <br /><br />
			  It may sound dumb at first, but think about it: Imagine your software on GitHub like a painting in an art 
			  gallery - and you are the artist. You want to show your cool painting off, right? But, at the same 
			  time, you don't want people to steal your painting or make a picture of your art and sell it, as if 
			  it were their own. Of course, they can always write your name at the bottom left of their stolen 
			  painting, but who reads that anyway?
